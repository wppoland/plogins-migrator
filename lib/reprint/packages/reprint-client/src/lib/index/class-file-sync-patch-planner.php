/**
 * Plans a file-sync patch from two indexed file trees.
 *
 * The patch base and patch head indexes are the left and right sides of the
 * comparison. Both indexes use the same path coordinates and are sorted by
 * decoded path bytes. The caller chooses these indexes based on the sync
 * intent:
 *
 * - To make two file trees identical, compare the current destination index
 *   with the current source index.
 * - To copy only source changes, compare the source index saved at the last
 *   sync with the current source index. Apply that patch to the destination.
 *
 * The planner does not know the sync intent. It receives the two indexes
 * already chosen by its caller.
 *
 * FileIndexDiffProcessor aligns their entries and labels each path. This
 * planner turns those labels into one operation for the current path:
 *
 * - `copy` copies the patch-head entry.
 * - `delete` deletes a path from the patch base.
 * - `replace` deletes a path, then copies the patch-head entry there.
 *
 * One path may need both actions. Replacing a directory tree with a file, for
 * example, deletes the tree and copies the file. The planner combines
 * a removed subtree into one deletion when the indexes allow it. It does not
 * detect renames or compare file contents. Here, minimizing means removing
 * redundant path operations, not finding the smallest possible patch.
 *
 * ## Sparse directory entries
 *
 * Non-empty directories have no index entry. Their descendants imply that the
 * directory exists. The planner uses the paths preceding and following the
 * current position to decide whether a missing directory still has a head
 * descendant. When a whole directory disappeared, it emits the highest
 * missing directory instead of deleting every indexed descendant.
 *
 * An append-only file keeps that deletion active while later base entries are
 * descendants of it. A sibling such as `tree-other` may sort between `tree`
 * and `tree/child`, so each active root links to the preceding one instead of
 * assuming all descendants are adjacent.
 *
 * ## Selection
 *
 * Included and excluded roots use the same coordinates as the index paths. An
 * empty included root selects every relative path. A planned operation is
 * omitted when its path falls outside every included root or intersects an
 * excluded root. The index diff still consumes that path.
 *
 * ## Traversal and resume
 *
 * Each call to next_path() processes at most one path. The getters describe
 * that path until the following call. is_complete() becomes true after the
 * last path. A false next_path() result means no path remains and stays false.
 *
 *     $planner = FileSyncPatchPlanner::create(
 *         $patch_base_index_file,
 *         $patch_head_index_file,
 *         $active_deletion_roots_file
 *     );
 *     while ($planner->next_path()) {
 *         $operation = $planner->get_operation();
 *         if ($operation !== null) {
 *             append_sync_operation($operation);
 *         }
 *         save_cursor($planner->get_cursor());
 *     }
 *     $planner->close();
 *
 * The cursor contains both index paths, the active deletion roots file, path
 * selection, and the current byte offsets. It does not contain index line
 * decoders; pass the same decoders to resume() that were passed to create().
 * The active deletion roots file may contain bytes beyond the cursor after an
 * interruption. resume() ignores those bytes.
