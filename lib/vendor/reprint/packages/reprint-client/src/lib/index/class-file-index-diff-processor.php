/**
 * Walks two filesystem indexes together in path order.
 *
 * ## What the indexes represent
 *
 * A filesystem index is a path-sorted list describing a filesystem tree at one
 * point in time. Each index entry records one path, whether that path is a file,
 * link, or directory, its size, its inode change time (ctime), and, for some
 * directories, whether it was empty. Both indexes must use the same path
 * coordinate system; paths may be local relative paths or remote absolute paths.
 * Each physical line must decode to one entry. The two indexes may use separate
 * decoders, and decoder-specific fields remain available through
 * `get_entry_in_old_index()` and `get_entry_in_new_index()`. A decoder cannot
 * filter lines; blank or invalid records must throw.
 *
 * This processor opens two such lists:
 *
 * - The **old index** describes the tree at the starting point.
 * - The **new index** describes the tree at the ending point.
 *
 * "Old" and "new" identify the snapshot which supplied an entry. They do not
 * describe traversal order within either index.
 *
 * ## How paths are compared
 *
 * `next_path()` selects the first unconsumed path found in either index. That
 * selected path becomes the **current path**. The current path can have:
 *
 * - an old entry and no new entry, making the path `deleted`;
 * - no old entry and a new entry, making the path `added`; or
 * - an entry in both indexes, making the path `modified` when its recorded
 *   type, size, or ctime differs and `unchanged` otherwise.
 *
 * For example, while `wp-content/a.txt` is current, its old entry is the
 * record for `wp-content/a.txt` in the old index. It is not the record for
 * the path visited immediately before it. If the old index does not contain
 * `wp-content/a.txt`, the current path has no old entry and
 * `get_path_type_in_old_index()` returns null.
 *
 * The processor labels that snapshot difference through `get_path_transition()`.
 * It does not decide whether to copy, remove, or preserve a path. That policy
 * remains with the caller.
 *
 * ## Current, preceding, and following paths
 *
 * The indexes are already sorted, so they can be merged in a single pass. The
 * processor retains at most one unread entry from each index and compares their
 * decoded path bytes. The retained old and new entries do not always name the
 * same path.
 *
 * Suppose the old index's retained entry is `b.txt` and the new index's
 * retained entry is `a.txt`. `a.txt` becomes the current path because it sorts
 * first. It has no old entry. Relative to `a.txt`, `b.txt` is the following path
 * in the old index.
 *
 * Current-path information and neighboring paths answer different questions:
 *
 * - `get_path_type_in_old_index()` describes the current path in the old index,
 *   or returns null when that index has no such path.
 * - When the current path is absent from the old index,
 *   `get_following_path_in_old_index()` returns the first old-index path which
 *   sorts after it.
 *
 * The corresponding new-index getters make the same distinction.
 * `get_preceding_path_in_new_index()` returns the closest new-index path which
 * sorts before the current path. `get_following_path_in_new_index()` returns the
 * closest new-index path which sorts after a current path absent from that
 * index. Together they bracket the position where that missing path would
 * appear in the new index.
 *
 * ## Traversal
 *
 * The first call to `next_path()` selects a path. Each subsequent call consumes
 * the current path, advances the cursor, and selects the following path:
 *
 *     $processor = FileIndexDiffProcessor::create($old_index, $new_index);
 *     $has_path = $processor->next_path();
 *     while ($has_path) {
 *         apply_path_operation(
 *             $processor->get_path(),
 *             $processor->get_path_transition()
 *         );
 *         $has_path = $processor->next_path();
 *         save_cursor($processor->get_cursor());
 *     }
 *     $processor->close();
 *
 * `next_path()` is the only public method which reads index entries. Information
 * getters do not move either file handle and return stable values until the
 * next call to `next_path()`.
 *
 * ## Resume boundaries
 *
 * The cursor records the byte offset after the last consumed entry in each
 * index and the new-index path preceding the next merge position. A selected
 * but unconsumed entry is deliberately not included. If a process stops before
 * advancing and storing the cursor, `resume()` selects that path again. Work
 * performed for one path must therefore tolerate replay, or its caller must
 * store a separate durable confirmation.
 *
 * Both JSONL indexes must remain immutable and sorted by decoded path bytes,
 * not by their base64 representation. The cursor identifies byte positions in
 * those same files; it does not identify or validate their contents. The new
 * index must exist. A missing old index represents an empty starting tree.
 *
 * Selecting a path may move the private file handles beyond the public cursor
 * while the processor retains unread entries. The cursor still names only
 * consumed entries and can always be passed to `resume()`.
