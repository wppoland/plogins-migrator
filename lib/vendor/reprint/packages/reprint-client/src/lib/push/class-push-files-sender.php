/**
 * Drives one local-files push through bounded planning and streaming requests.
 *
 * PushFilesSender owns the only caller-visible push lifecycle. Its caller holds
 * the Reprint process lock while the sender creates and removes the target push
 * session, drives its internal PushPlan, streams the selected paths, commits the
 * push, and saves the completed fresh local index as the local index for this
 * remote Reprint API URL. The target owns the
 * upload cursor for every path and for the deletion list. Durable sender state
 * retains the top-level phase, the selected path-list cursor, the planned
 * totals, the target-confirmed completed-path count and file bytes, learned
 * request limits, and the PushPlan cursor needed after a process restart.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 *  1. Acquire the Reprint process lock, then start a new sender with `start()`
 *     or continue an unfinished sender with `resume()`.
 *  2. Call `next_step()` while the current process has enough time and memory
 *     for another step.
 *  3. Call `close()` and release the Reprint process lock, even when more work
 *     remains.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *     $process_lock = new ReprintProcessLock($state_dir);
 *     $sender = $first_run
 *         ? PushFilesSender::start($options, $process_lock)
 *         : PushFilesSender::resume($options, $process_lock);
 *     try {
 *         while ($has_time_remaining() && $has_memory_available()) {
 *             if (!$sender->next_step()) {
 *                 break;
 *             }
 *         }
 *         $status = $sender->get_status();
 *     } finally {
 *         if ($sender->get_status() === 'continue') {
 *             $sender->cancel();
 *         }
 *         $sender->close();
 *         $process_lock->close();
 *     }
 *
 * The caller may cancel whenever next_step() returns true. cancel() abandons an
 * open multipart request and returns the in-memory sender to its preceding
 * durable boundary. close() only releases sender resources; it never finishes
 * an open request or releases the caller's process lock. If a process stops
 * without closing, the next
 * process starts from the preceding durable boundary and reads
 * receiver-confirmed work before sending more data.
 *
 * A new sender calls `push_create` to learn target-owned exclusions before
 * starting PushPlan. Caller exclusions are added to that policy, and the combined
 * list stays with the active plan across resume. The plan builds the fresh local
 * index and diffs it against the local index for this remote Reprint API URL,
 * one bounded step at a time.
 * That index contains the most recent fresh scan the sender finished saving
 * after the target confirmed its corresponding files-push commit, and is also
 * read by files-diff. After planning
 * completes, local files, symlinks, and empty directories stream through
 * multipart requests. The raw deletion list follows, and repeated `push_commit`
 * calls let the target install the work in bounded steps. A target-confirmed
 * commit enters another phase which saves the fresh local index as the local
 * index for this remote Reprint API URL through a swap file. Index completion,
 * plan completion, local-index saving, and plan discard each have a separate
 * durable phase. A stopped process therefore repeats only an idempotent
 * boundary action rather than a group of unrelated transitions.
 *
 * sender.json owns the top-level phase and the cursor returned by
 * PushPlan. PushFilesSender stores that cursor after every completed planning
 * step but never interprets its shape. It obtains planning progress from
 * PushPlan's raw progress snapshot. The sender creates the active plan directory
 * before planning and removes the whole directory only after success or
 * target-session removal. The local index for this remote
 * Reprint API URL remains in the remote state directory. Once the plan result
 * is saved or discarded, the sender clears its cursor before removing the plan
 * directory without reopening PushPlan.
 *
 * ## Resume after local changes
 *
 * Each selected path to push carries the type, size, and ctime from the fresh
 * local index used for planning. The sender compares the live path with those
 * values before sending and again after each read. A difference removes the
 * upload-only push session, because its work and the planned local index no
 * longer describe the same filesystem root.
 *
 * Receiver-confirmed file and deletion-list positions are never copied into
 * active state. A newly opened sender reads them from `push_status`; a
 * successful upload keeps them in memory for later steps in the same lifecycle.
 * The sender sends the completed deletion plan without checking the live local
 * tree again. A local path which reappears after planning may therefore be
 * deleted by this push; the next push will send it again. If a local path to
 * push changes, the sender removes the upload-only push session, discards the
 * plan, and changes the sender status to `restart` so the caller can start a
 * new sender which builds a fresh local index.
 *
 * ## Streaming and durability
 *
 * Each local-path upload or deletion step sends at most one multipart part and
 * holds at most one bounded payload string. A deletion part contains one path,
 * except for the empty part which marks the deletion list complete.
 * Multipart bytes leave for the network before `send_part()` returns. One
 * request carries successive parts until its request-body budget is spent or
 * the current path phase ends. An open sender retains that request, its
 * path-list handles, and its current local file handle between steps.
 *
 * Saving a complete local index after commit is the deliberate exception to
 * bounded steps.
 * A representative index entry is about 150 bytes, so one million paths produce
 * roughly 150 MB. Even a 10 MiB/s drive copies that in about 15 seconds. Keeping
 * two copy cursors, two retained handles, and per-chunk state writes for larger
 * installations is not justified until measurements show otherwise. PHP's
 * copy() streams the bytes through a swap file, and rename() atomically moves
 * the completed copy into place. This accepts that a 1 MiB/s drive reaches 30
 * seconds at roughly 200,000 paths. A stopped copy is repeated by the next call.
 *
 * The sender has no overall time limit. The caller decides whether to take
 * another step. Network operations apply connect, no-progress, and response
 * wait limits, while a connection that continues moving bytes may run longer.
