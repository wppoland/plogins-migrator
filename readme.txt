Back up, clone and migrate your whole site to one file, then restore it here or on a new host. URLs and paths are fixed for you. Runs on your server.

== Description ==

Migrator packs your database and everything in `wp-content` into a single file you can download, keep as a backup, and restore, on the same site or on a brand-new install somewhere else. When you restore onto a different address, Migrator rewrites the old URLs and file paths to the new ones for you, so the site just works.

Everything happens on your own server. There is no account to create, no file size sold back to you, and nothing is ever sent to a third-party service. Because it is fully open, you can read exactly what it does: the source lives at https://github.com/wppoland/plogins-migrator, which is also where to file a bug or request a feature.

**How it works**

1. On the site you want to copy, create a backup. Migrator writes your database to a portable SQL dump and streams every file in `wp-content` into one archive next to it.
2. Download that archive (or, on a big site, build it from the command line, see below).
3. On the destination, the same site to roll back, or a fresh WordPress install to move to, restore the archive. Migrator imports the database, puts the files back, and rewrites the source site's web address and paths to this one.

The address rewrite is **safe for serialized data**: Migrator walks the actual data structures rather than doing a blind text replace, so the byte-length counts PHP stores inside serialized options and meta stay correct and nothing breaks.

**A few things worth knowing**

Backups are written to a protected folder (`wp-content/migrator-backups`) that denies direct web access, and the in-browser download is served only to logged-in administrators through an authenticated handler, the files are never exposed at a guessable URL. Each item inside an archive carries a checksum, so a truncated or corrupted backup is caught before it is ever restored over a live site.

Restoring **overwrites** the destination database and files, that is the point of a restore, so it asks for confirmation and is limited to administrators. Migrator never overwrites its own plugin folder during a restore, so it cannot pull the rug out from under itself mid-import.

For large sites where a browser request would time out, every job also runs from WP-CLI, which has no timeout:

`wp migrator export`
`wp migrator import path/to/backup.migrator`

**What's included**

* One-click backup of your database and all of `wp-content` into a single archive
* Restore to the same site, or migrate to a new host with automatic, serialization-safe URL and path rewriting
* Choose what to leave out: media, themes, plugins, cache, spam comments, post revisions, transients, WooCommerce sessions or Action Scheduler tables
* In-browser export with a progress bar and a direct download, resumable so large sites finish across multiple steps, plus drag-and-drop restore
* WP-CLI `export` and `import` commands for sites too large for the browser
* A safety snapshot of your database before every restore, rolled back automatically if anything fails
* Per-item checksums so a corrupt archive is detected, not restored
* Serialization-safe search and replace across the database, with a dry-run preview and a `wp migrator replace` command, to change a domain, URL or path safely
* Inspect any stored backup before you restore it: source URL, WordPress and PHP versions, table count, plus pre-restore checks for table prefix, disk space and writability
* Self-hosted: no account, no third-party service, nothing leaves your server

The free edition backs up and migrates your whole site by hand. **Plogins Migrator PRO** makes it run itself:

* **Scheduled and incremental backups** - daily or weekly with retention; only changed files after a baseline
* **Cloud and off-site copies** - S3, R2, Backblaze B2, Wasabi, FTP/SFTP, WebDAV, Dropbox and Google Drive
* **Recovery points** - one-click rollback to a known-good backup
* **Encrypted backups** - password-protected archives, decrypted on restore
* **Server-to-server transfer** - move a site between servers with no manual download
* **Email notifications and activity log** - a silent failure never slips by
* **Full multisite** - back up and migrate a whole network with correct URL rewriting

Everything in the free edition stays free and open. Plogins Migrator PRO starts at 49 EUR per year (PLN shown at checkout).

= Does restoring delete what is already on the destination? =

Yes. A restore replaces the destination's database and files with the contents of the archive, that is what restoring a backup means. It is limited to administrators and asks for confirmation first. Always keep a separate backup of anything on the destination you want to keep.

= Will my links break when I move to a new domain? =

No. When you restore onto a different address, Migrator rewrites the old site URL and file paths to the new ones, including inside serialized data, so internal links and settings keep working.

= My site is large and the browser export stops. What do I do? =

Use WP-CLI, which has no request time limit: `wp migrator export` to build the archive and `wp migrator import <file>` to restore it.

= Does it send my data anywhere? =

No. Migrator runs entirely on your own server. It creates no account and contacts no external service. Your backups stay in `wp-content/migrator-backups` until you download or delete them.

= Where are my backups stored? =

In `wp-content/migrator-backups`, a folder protected from direct web access. Removing the plugin deletes that folder and its contents.


= Does this plugin work on WordPress Multisite? =

Yes. This plugin is compatible with WordPress Multisite. Network activate it or activate it on individual sites; each site keeps its own settings and data.

== Screenshots ==

1. The Migrator screen: create a backup with presets and exclusion options, alongside restore and your saved backups.
2. The file-size explorer: scan wp-content and see each folder's size so you can leave out what you do not need.

== Translations ==

Plogins Migrator includes Polish, German and Spanish translations for the plugin interface. The text domain is `plogins-migrator`, so WordPress.org language packs can also override or extend these bundled translations.

== Changelog ==

* Added a contextual written migration-help link after a successful backup.
* Fixed disk-space preflight formatting type handling.

= 1.2.0 =
* New: standalone serialization-safe search and replace (admin tool + dry run + `wp migrator replace`) to change a domain, URL or path without corrupting serialized data.
* New: inspect a stored backup before restoring - shows the source URL, WordPress and PHP versions and table count, and runs pre-restore checks (table prefix, disk space, writable files).

= 1.1.1 =
* Added a Free vs PRO overview to the readme.

= 1.1.0 =
* New: in-plugin overview of Plogins Migrator PRO (incremental + scheduled backups, off-site storage, one-click cloud restore) on the admin screen.

= 1.0.1 =
* First stable release.

= 0.3.3 =
* Renamed to Plogins Migrator for a more distinctive plugin name.

= 0.3.2 =
* Tidier saved-backup rows: the date and size lead, the long file name is a muted single line that no longer wraps, and the row reflows neatly on narrow screens.

= 0.3.1 =
* Your saved backups now appear inside the "Restore a backup" card, so you can restore one in place without scrolling past it.

= 0.3.0 =
* New "Your backups" section: every backup stored on the site is listed with its date and size, so you can download, restore or delete it in one click without leaving the screen.
